              My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things
              that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
              appreciate any of it because there was too much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
              didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <p class="accent">How I turned things around</p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                everything</strong
              >. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my
              place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
            </p>
            <p>
              It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
              place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
            </p>
            <p class="accent">Now I live the simple life</p>
            <p>
              Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
              less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
              to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
              With how much it turned my life around<strong
                >, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
                it</strong
              >, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
              which is why I started this site!
